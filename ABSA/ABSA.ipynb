Skip the dip; balance the tangy chips by alternating bites of raw vegetable.<br /><br />As an Oregonian, I'm proud to share these delectable snacks with friends, especially those living outside our state and who haven't experienced gourmet chips. I tell them Kettle Brand does for potato chips what microbrews did for beer.<br /><br />Kettle Brand potato chips are unmistakable--a light gold color, rich flavor and amazing crunch. Kettle Brand chips are also a healthier snacking option than the major chip brands. Kettle Brand chips don't have trans fats, MSG or artificial flavors and colorings. The company also has a line of organic potato chips and all of their products are certified Kosher.<br /><br />I also recommend <a href=\\\"http://www.HealthyFoods.com/gp/product/B000G6MBV4\\\">Kettle Chips Honey Dijon</a> and <a href=\\\"http://www.HealthyFoods.com/gp/product/B000G6Q4GM\\\">Kettle Chips Spicy Thai</a>.<br /><br />Annette Solomon, a reporter for the Salem Statesman Journal recently noted that a glass of wine goes nicely with these chips. Solomon wrote, \\\"...you could be missing out on a wonderful pairing. These chips are spicy, so you would want to select a semi-sweet white wine. Also, a moderate amount of acid will subdue the strong flavors of ginger, lime, garlic and cilantro without over-powering them. Classically, a German-style Riesling fits these parameters perfectly.\\\"\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n

Pada 2 dari 5 aspek, jika digunakan rasio lain (misalnya 70:30 atau 80:20), jumlah data pada kelas negatif di salah satu *set* (*train/test*) menjadi sangat sedikit (hanya 1 atau 2 data) yang berisiko mengganggu proses pelatihan maupun evaluasi model. Sehingga digunakan rasio 60:40 untuk menjaga distribusi sentimen tetap seimbang dan data negatif tetap cukup tersedia untuk proses pembelajaran dan pengujian."],"metadata":{"id":"YCb2AkhLiDFA"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# Klasifikasi Per Aspek dengan SVM"],"metadata":{"id":"MrEXiQqtypZn"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# REBUILD df_raw agar kolom 'Text' ada kembali\n","raw_data = []\n","\n","for _, row in data.iterrows():\n","    text = row['cleaning']\n","    sentiment_result = compute(text, aspects)\n","    raw_data.extend(sentiment_result)\n","\n","df_raw = pd.DataFrame(raw_data, columns=['Aspect', 'Sentiment', 'Text'])\n","\n","# Cek kolom-kolom\n","print(\"Kolom df_raw:\", df_raw.columns.tolist())\n"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"lkK94VbLoiiW","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1749188039945,"user_tz":-420,"elapsed":95482,"user":{"displayName":"Dinah Zhahirah Febriyanti","userId":"12272226336999062428"}},"outputId":"4c429bd4-482a-448d-d304-4e79dbcde085"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Kolom df_raw: ['Aspect', 'Sentiment', 'Text']\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\n","from sklearn.svm import LinearSVC\n","from sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline\n","from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer\n","from sklearn.metrics import classification_report\n","\n","print(\"\\n===== Klasifikasi Sentimen Berdasarkan Aspek =====\\n\")\n","\n","for aspect in df_raw['Aspect'].unique():\n","    df_aspect = df_raw[df_raw['Aspect'] == aspect]\n","\n","    print(f\"Aspect: {aspect}\")\n","    print(f\"  Total Data: {len(df_aspect)}\")\n","    print(f\"    Positif: {(df_aspect['Sentiment'] == 'positive').sum()}\")\n","    print(f\"    Negatif: {(df_aspect['Sentiment'] == 'negative').sum()}\")\n","\n","    #
